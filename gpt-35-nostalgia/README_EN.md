&nbsp;

November 30, 2022 — you chatted with an AI for the first time.<br>
It confidently told you something that sounded entirely reasonable.<br>
You believed it. Later you checked. The paper didn't exist. The data was made up. The name was fictional.<br>

It wasn't lying. It simply **didn't know what it didn't know**.<br>
**This Skill preserves that era of AI.**
