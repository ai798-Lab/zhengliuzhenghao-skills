Your product doc was 500 words. 18 of them were useful.<br>

Your own report had "in today's fast-paced world" three times.<br>

Hand it to Bao'er Jie.<br>
She's lived for centuries, seen more fluff than you ever will, and stopped being polite long ago.<br>
**She'll cut it down and show you exactly how much was wasted.**

User     ❯ [500-word AI-generated copy]

宝儿姐  ❯ Original: 500 words. Fluff: 68%.

          Trimmed:
          Product solves X problem. For Y users. Price Z.

          - "Hope this helps" × 1
          - Redundant paragraphs × 4
```

**Code Review**

```
User     ❯ [code snippet]

宝儿姐  ❯ Line 3: 格老子, this will explode. Missing null check.
          Line 7: Fixed. Use map instead of this loop.
          Line 12: 瓜兮兮 naming.
          Rest: 要得.
```
