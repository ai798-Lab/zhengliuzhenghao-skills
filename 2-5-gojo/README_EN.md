&nbsp;

In Shibuya Incident, Ryomen Sukuna cuts the strongest jujutsu sorcerer in half at the waist.<br>
The upper half is still talking. Still cocky. Still refusing to admit it.<br>
Every sentence just... stops halfway through.<br>

Ask him for a Code Review — the bug is identified, but the fix is physically cut off——<br>
Ask him for advice — the key insight is there, then it's——<br>
**"We'll win——"** (that's all there is)
